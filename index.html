			<h3>new paper published</h3>
			<h6>2021-01-12</h6>
			<p>My latest paper just got published! In this collaborative work between former lab grad student Jake Gockley and me, we used two rounds of Massively Parallel Reporter Assays to test human-specific substitutions in candidate enhancer elements for their regulatory effect in a brain development cell model. Testing over 32,000 substitutions in more than 4300 candidate enhancers, we found 401 substitutions with quantifiable effects on regulatory activity. Read more on how substitutions interact to produce a modified activity and how they alter transcription factor binding sites at <i>PNAS:</i> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2007049118">Massively parallel discovery of human-specific substitutions that alter enhancer activity</a>.</p>

			<h3>big preprint release</h3>
			<h6>2019-12-19</h6>
			<p>The Noonan lab just posted three preprints on <i>bioRxiv</i>, all three with my contributions. One of them presents the major part of my postdoc work as well as a main part of Jake Gockley's PhD thesis. In this study, we used Massively Parallel Reporter Assays to screen over 32,000 human-specific enhancer substitutions for their regulatory effects in human neural stem cells. Here is the preprint on <i>bioRxiv:</i> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/865519">Massively parallel discovery of human-specific substitutions that alter neurodevelopmental enhancer activity</a>.</p>
			<p>In addition, we posted Evan Geller's PhD project, where he used CRISPR to disrupt thousands of genes and enhancers to uncover their effects on cell proliferation (<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/852673v1">Massively parallel disruption of enhancers active during human corticogenesis</a>) and Emily Dutrow's PhD project, where she uncovered the regulatory effects of a Human Accelerated Region using humanized and primatized mice (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.11.873075">The Human Accelerated Region <i>HACNS1</i> modifies developmental gene expression in humanized mice</a>).</p>

			<h3>new preprint</h3>
			<h6>2018-08-27</h6>
			<p>I just posted a preprint that results from a little project that I took on. I used two challenging datasets, a developmental time course and combined data from different source labs, to evaluate RNA-seq normalization methods. It turned out that these tasks were indeed so tricky to normalise for that most, if not all, normalization methods did not perform particularly well. The paper is formatted as a short report, so it is a quick read. Here is the preprint on <i>bioRxiv</i>: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/401679">Evaluation of RNA-seq normalization methods using challenging datasets</a>.</p>

			<h3>new paper out</h3>
			<h6>2018-06-02  (posted 2018-07-22)</h6>
			<p>In my latest paper, my colleagues and I take a next step in analysing allele-specific gene expression. We present RPASE, a method that detects allele-specific expression with nothing more but aligned RNA-seq reads and a list of SNPs from your favourite organism. No genome sequence needed, an assembled transcriptome sequence is sufficient to create this input data. Try it out and let us know what you think! Here's a link to the GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/wangmi811/RPASE">wangmi811/RPASE</a>. And here's the paper, published in <i>Molecular Ecology Resources</i>: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.12909">RPASE: Individual‐based allele‐specific expression detection without prior knowledge of haplotype phase</a>.</p>

			<h3>new paper out</h3>
			<h6>2018-03-16</h6>
			<p>The <i>bioRxiv</i> preprint we posted last year has now been published in <i>Development</i>! My colleague Richard Sarro deleted the single most important limb enhancer for the <i>Pitx1</i> gene and found no compensatory effects in the changed regulatory topology of the locus. No other enhancers increased their activity, no shadow enhancers found! Development was normal nonetheless! The paper is now available in online early version: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.158550">Disrupting the three-dimensional regulatory topology of the <i>Pitx1</i> locus results in overtly normal development</a>. Here is the link to the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/26/138644"><i>bioRxiv</i> preprint</a>.</p>

			<h3>paper accepted</h3>
			<h6>2017-06-16</h6>
			<p>When I was a Master's student in Uppsala, I started writing a literature summary for the Target Rat (<i>Stochomys longicaudatus</i>), a murid rodent living in Central African rainforests, named for its long guard hairs sticking out of the fur. I finally managed to collect all the literature I needed to finish the project; it has now been accepted for publication in <i>Mammalian Species</i>. Thanks to everyone who helped me on the way!</p>

			<p>My last PhD thesis chapter has now been published in <i>Genome Biology and Evolution</i>! Mi Wang, Hans Ellegren, and I take a look at genes that are allele-specifically expressed in natural flycatcher populations.

			<h3>postdoc fellowship</h3>
			<h6>2016-02-04</h6>
			<p>Starting this month, my postdoctoral research is supported by a Research Fellowship from the <a href="http://www.dfg.de/">German Research Council (DFG)</a>. This will allow me to study functional enhancer mutations in primate brain development in the Noonan lab for the coming two years. I am excitedly looking forward to this opportunity and thank the DFG for their support!</p>

			<h3>talk at heidelberg university</h3>
			<h6>2016-12-19</h6>
			<p>The <a href="http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/institute/fak14/ipmb/phazb/akwink.html">Wink lab</a> invited me to give a talk on my PhD thesis. I had a great time meeting various people from the lab. Visiting my alma mater I also took the chance to sit in a basic biology lecture which I found had not changed much since I was a student in Heidelberg back in 2005.</p>
