        <p>In my research I have studied a number of interesting questions relating to the evolution of different organisms. So far I have mainly used genome-wide approaches to address broad questions in evolution.</p>

        <h3>gene expression on avian sex chromosomes</h3>
        <p>In a pair of dimorphic sex chromosomes, one of the chromosomes has decayed during the course of evolution and lost much of its genetic information. This is problematic because the heterogametic sex will suffer from having half the number of sex chromosomal genes and their products compared to the other sex, and compared to autosomes. In many organisms, dosage compensation systems have been found that re-establish dosage equality. Birds, however, lack such a mechanism so that female birds have less gene products from their sex chromosomes. I investigated this by analysing genome-wide transcriptome and proteome data from different bird species. This confirmed that birds do not compensate gene dosage on mRNA level (Uebbing <i>et al.</i> 2013) and showed that this neither is the case on protein level (Uebbing, Konzer, Xu <i>et al.</i> 2015). I also used gene expression data to annotate the avian W chromosome (Smeds <i>et al.</i> 2014) and to identify and analyse their pseudo-autosomal region (Smeds <i>et al.</i> 2015).</p>

        <h3>gene expression diversity and divergence</h3>
        <p>In this project I studied of the origin and divergence of regulatory diversity in natural bird populations. I compared population samples of the transcriptomes of two <i>Ficedula</i> flycatcher species which speciated less than one million years ago. I found very little expression divergence in this young species pair and no support for predicted correlations of expression divergence with sequence divergence or pleiotropy (Uebbing <i>et al.</i> 2016). Data from this effort was also used in a large study on genomic divergence in these flycatchers (Ellegren <i>et al.</i> 2012). I further used RNA-seq data to quantify allele-specific gene expression in natural flycatcher populations. This showed that there is a substantial amount of expression diversity within wild populations that may provide a starting point for gene expression divergence (Wang <i>et al. in preparation</i>).</p>

        <h3>the impact of enhancer mutations</h3>
        <p>In my newest project I set out to analyse the effects of enhancer mutations on gene expression. Knowing what effects mutations in gene regulatory regions have on the organism is important both for medical genetics and for evolutionary comparisons between lineages. I hope that my research will help to answer some burning questions. Stay tuned for future development!</p>
